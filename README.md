## // HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT

## This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project has been developed with React JS, Semantic UI React and Styled Components

The font theme used for the project is Lato and Permanent Marker from Google Fonts as I wanted to preserve the original style of the whitepapers available on Human IT's website.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

* Make sure that port 3000 and 3001 are available since the web app and node server are programmed to run on those ports

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run lint`
Makes a check on App.js and all the files in src/components and logs errors and warnings based on the eslint rules of the project and airbnb's style guide for ES6 and React.

### `npm run lint:fix`
Fixes errors and warnings based on the eslint rules of the project and airbnb's style guide for ES6 and React and logs reamining errors and warnings that need manual solving.
